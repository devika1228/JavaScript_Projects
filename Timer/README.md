# ⏳ Timer Project

This project is a simple countdown timer built using JavaScript. The timer allows users to set a specific duration, and it counts down to zero, displaying the remaining time dynamically on the screen.

## ✨ Features
- ⏱️ Set a custom countdown duration.
- 🔄 Real-time updates of the remaining time.
- 🛑 Automatically stops when the countdown reaches zero.

## ⚙️ How It Works
The timer functionality is implemented using JavaScript's `setInterval` method to update the display every second. The logic calculates the remaining time by subtracting the current time from the target end time. When the countdown reaches zero, the interval is cleared to stop further updates.

## 💡 Inspiration and Credits
This project was inspired by the tutorial on creating a JavaScript countdown timer from [Hackr.io](https://hackr.io/blog/how-to-create-a-javascript-countdown-timer). The tutorial provided a clear and concise guide, which was adapted and customized for this project.

## 🛠️ Usage
1. 📂 Clone the repository.
2. 🌐 Open the `index.html` file in a browser.
3. ⏳ Set the desired countdown duration and start the timer.

This project serves as a practical example of working with JavaScript's time-related functions and DOM manipulation.
